# Web design assets for the hasty ones

It doesn't take too much time and knowledge to design a simple-to-code, lightweight, easy-to-maintain website, blog or portfolio. You can achieve pretty good results by simply using some CSS framework and/or static sie generator and following along their respective documentations.
Here's a bunch of resources for easy, low-level web design purposes. Basically no JavaScript knowledge's required, only a bit of HTML and CSS.
